# Blob3D_fractsed

This repository contains scripts for processing Blob3D output -dat.xlsx files. This code may be useful for sedimentological applications including assessing shape parameters, creating clastsize distribution histograms, and for statistically assessing spatial orientation.

>Blob3D is designed for efficient measurement of up to thousands of discrete features (e.g. clasts,mineral grains, porphyroblasts, voids) within a single sample. Blob3D is unique because it gives the program operator primary control over data interpretation and measurement, and all computations are carried out in 3D, rather than individually on a series of 2D slices.

## Installation

No installation is required. Scripts are short and designed to be adapted and applied to various problems. Python scripts can be downloaded from this repository and either imported as modules locally, copied into scripts and run as defined functions, or intergrating into pre-existing scripts where such functionality is required.

## Python Scripts

All python scripts import the -dat.xlsx generated when performing "Extract" within Blob3D. Python scripts use the heading names automatically generated in the exported file. For studying orientation, shape, and shape factors a primitive ellipsoid will need to be fitted (and the equation reported) to ensure the correct coefficients. See the Blob3D user guide for details. 

Expected output figures from each script are provided, using the example dataset `example/example_blob3d_spreadsheet.xlsx`

#### _fractual_plot.py

Creates a log-log cumulative plot of the number of clasts with a diameter **d** and greater **N(>d)** against that clast diameter **d**. Values annotating linear fits are the fractal dimension '*D-value*'.

#### _clastshape_zingg_plot.py

Creates a Zingg (1935) diagram that shows the relative dimensions of the long (L), short (S), and
intermediate (I) axes of a particle.

#### _shape_factor_plot.py

Creates a plot of the **shape factor** as defined by Wilson and Huang (1979) against clast diameter **d**

Shape factor is defined as `(ShapeB+ShapeC)/2*ShapeA`

#### _steronetplot.py

Creates a stereonet of orientation based on sphericity and minimum clast diameter. Plots using [mplstereonet](https://pypi.org/project/mplstereonet/) for the parameters imported from the -dat.xlsx file.
